# GCPTutorial

**GCPTutorial** is a collection of Python code examples that demonstrate good vs. bad coding practices. It includes simple snippets and realistic scripts to help developers learn how to write clean, maintainable, and error-resistant Python code.

## 🔧 What's Included

- Comparisons of bad and good coding styles [`Examples.md`](Examples.md)
- Practical examples: employee bonus calculation, grade processing, CLI apps, API usage, CSV parsing
- Sample data files: `employees.txt`, `orders.csv`
- A presentation (`.pptx`) for training or teaching

## 📦 Requirements

Some scripts require external libraries. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

> Note: Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the weather example with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. If you want to use it.

## ▶️ Running Examples

Run any Python file using:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

Make sure the required data files (like `employees.txt` or `orders.csv`) are in the correct directory.
